# NapsterVents

*This was done as a group project that utilizes the Napster API, the TicketMaster API, and Firebase to pull up artist information and any concerts for that artist in your area. Allows saving of favorite artists and events. My contribution to this project was to produce the front end, integrate the Napster API, and assist in general planning and troubleshooting.*

*Group Members: Jackie Nguyen, James Scott, Chanel Maddox, and Chris Lynam*

#### Technology Used:

`HTML 5` `CSS 3` `JavaScript` `jQuery` `Firebase`
